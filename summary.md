## Resampling

1. The Naive Random Oversampling model gave me the best balanced accuracy score.
2. The Cluster Centroids model gave me the best recall score.
3. The Naive Random Oversampling model had the best geometric mean score.

## Ensamble

1. The Easy Ensemble gave a better balanced accuracy score
2. The Easy Ensemble had a better recall score.
3. The Easy Ensemble had a better geometric mean score.
4. The top three features from the balanced random forest model were 'total_rec_int', 'total_pymnt_inv', and 'last_pymnt_amnt'
